# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Logan Owens, and I took this major because I really didn't know what to choose and the dart landed here. Even though I am not very good with this stuff, I plan to do my best in here no matter what and hope to learn all I can. I also enjoy things comics, sci-fi movies, cooking and trying new things no matter how bad I am at them. Much like this course, I am willing to give this major a go and do my best, too far to back down now.
